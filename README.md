## Main Projects:

### [LeftOfBoom](https://github.com/jack-toast/LeftOfBoom)
*Left of Boom* is a physics and mechanics focused adventure game set in space. Using a computerâ€™s mouse the player controls the spaceship much like you would aim the cue ball in a pool game, but with a twist: instead staggered discrete turns, the game plays continuously with the aiming of the cannon also slowing down time.

Asteroids are spawned by looking at a black and white image (Script: assets/scripts/LoadAsteroidsFromImage.cs, Image to edit: /assets/LevelImages/bigCircle.png)


### [Gladexa](https://github.com/jack-toast/gladexa)
Alexa based project that uses Portal's GLaDOS as the voice. Doesn't work all that well now. Looking to integrate with my home automation in the future.
