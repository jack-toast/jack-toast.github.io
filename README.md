# Jack Toast's Project Hub

## Main Projects:

### [Gladexa](https://github.com/jack-toast/gladexa)
Alexa based project that uses Portal's GLaDOS as the voice. Doesn't work all that well now. Looking to integrate with my home automation in the future.

### [Fluffy Lookin](https://github.com/jack-toast/nerf-turret)
Fluffy lookin nerf-herder. It's a nerf turret with face recognition. That's pretty much it. 

### [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jack-toast/jupyter-notebooks)
